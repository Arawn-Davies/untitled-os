"""Background ktest verification group.

Verifies that the background ktest task completed successfully.

Always advances to the first keyboard_getchar call (shell REPL entry) so that
subsequent groups get a clean, consistent stopping point outside any ISR frame.
This avoids "Cannot execute this command while the target is running" errors
that occur when GDB is stopped inside a timer ISR (timer_callback) and the
next group tries to install a new breakpoint.
