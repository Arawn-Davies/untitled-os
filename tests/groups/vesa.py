"""VESA framebuffer group.

Verifies the state of the VESA framebuffer driver and, when the framebuffer
is active, that the VESA TTY was successfully initialised.

This group is entered with execution stopped inside timer_callback (left
there by the hardware_state group).  State variables are read directly from
the stopped inferior; no further `continue` is issued because after boot the
kernel blocks in shell_run() → keyboard_getchar() waiting for PS/2 input, so
there is no autonomous terminal output to intercept.

If no framebuffer was provided by the bootloader (e.g. headless CI) the
group still passes — what matters is that the driver handled the absence
cleanly and did not crash.
