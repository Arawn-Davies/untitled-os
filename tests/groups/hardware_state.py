"""Hardware-state group.

Verifies CPU register state and liveness after the boot sequence:
  1. CR0.PG (bit 31) must be set  – paging was enabled.
  2. CR3 must be non-zero         – page directory is loaded.
  3. timer_callback must fire     – PIT is ticking (kernel is alive).

This group is entered with execution stopped at kernel_post_boot (the last
boot checkpoint).  It reads CR0/CR3 while stopped there, then installs a
one-shot breakpoint on timer_callback and continues.  On return the PIT
liveness check is evaluated.
