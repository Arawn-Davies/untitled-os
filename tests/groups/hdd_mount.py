"""HDD mount verification group.

Verifies that vfs_auto_mount() successfully mounted the FAT32 partition
from the boot HDD at /hd.  Entered with execution stopped inside the
running kernel (after hardware_state stopped at timer_callback).

A pass confirms the full HDD boot path:
  grub-install core.img → Multiboot2 → IDE detected ATA drive →
  part_probe found MBR FAT32 partition → fat32_mount() accepted the BPB.
