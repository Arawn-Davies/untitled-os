# shell — Interactive kernel command shell

**Header:** `kernel/include/kernel/shell.h`  
**Sources:** `kernel/arch/i386/shell/shell.c`, `shell_cmd_*.c`, `shell_help.c`

Provides an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) running as a cooperative
kernel task (`shell_run`).  Four independent shell instances run concurrently
on TTYs 1–4 (Alt+F1–F4 switches focus).

---

## How it works

`shell_run` loops forever, printing a prompt, reading a line of input,
splitting it into tokens, and dispatching to a command handler.

### Input (`shell_readline`)

Handles inline editing: cursor movement, insert-at-point, Backspace, Enter,
Ctrl+C (aborts line, prints `^C`), history navigation (↑/↓ up to 16 entries),
and Tab completion (first token: command names; subsequent tokens: VFS paths
via `vfs_complete()`).

### Parsing

Splits the input in-place on spaces into up to 8 `argv`-style tokens.  Empty
lines are skipped.

### Dispatch

Commands are looked up in a **module table** — a NULL-terminated array of
`shell_cmd_entry_t[]` pointers, one per category file:

```c
static const shell_cmd_entry_t * const cmd_modules[] = {
    man_cmds, help_cmds, display_cmds, system_cmds,
    disk_cmds, fs_cmds, apps_cmds, fileops_cmds, NULL,
};
```

If no built-in matches, the shell searches `/cdrom/apps/` then `/hd/apps/`
for a matching ELF and runs it via `elf_exec`.

## Functions

### `shell_run`

```c
void shell_run(void);
```

Enter the interactive shell loop.  Never returns.  Called as the entry point
of each TTY task.

### `shell_readline`

```c
void shell_readline(char *buf, size_t size);
```

Read one line of input into `buf` with full inline editing, history, and Tab
completion.  Used by both the shell REPL and `SYS_READ` for stdin.
