# timer — PIT timer driver and `ksleep`

**Header:** `kernel/include/kernel/timer.h`  
**Source:** `kernel/arch/i386/hardware/timer.c`

Programs the Intel 8253/8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) channel 0 to
fire IRQ 0 at a configurable frequency, and provides a busy-wait sleep
function built on the resulting tick counter.

## PIT I/O ports

| Port | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `0x40` | R/W | Channel 0 data — divisor (lo byte then hi byte). |
| `0x41` | R/W | Channel 1 data (unused; historically DRAM refresh). |
| `0x42` | R/W | Channel 2 data (unused; drives PC speaker). |
| `0x43` | Write | Mode/Command register. |

## How it works

The PIT's input clock runs at **1 193 180 Hz** (derived from the original
IBM PC 14.318 MHz crystal divided by 12).  To achieve a desired frequency `f`,
a 16-bit divisor `1193180 / f` is written to PIT channel 0 (port `0x40`).
The PIT then fires IRQ 0 every `divisor` clock cycles.

The command byte `0x36` written to port `0x43` selects:
- Channel 0 (bits 7–6 = `00`)
- Lo-byte then hi-byte access (bits 5–4 = `11`)
- Mode 3: square-wave generator (bits 3–1 = `011`)
- Binary counting (bit 0 = `0`)

At boot Makar calls `init_timer(50)`, giving a tick rate of **50 Hz** (one
tick every 20 ms).

Each IRQ 0 fires `timer_callback`, which increments the global `tick` counter
and calls `t_spinner_tick(tick)` to animate the terminal spinner.

## Functions

### `init_timer`

```c
void init_timer(uint32_t frequency);
```

Configure PIT channel 0 to interrupt at `frequency` Hz and enable CPU
interrupts.

1. Registers `timer_callback` on `IRQ0`.
2. Computes the 16-bit divisor (`1193180 / frequency`).
3. Writes command byte `0x36` to port `0x43`.
4. Writes the divisor to port `0x40` (lo byte first, then hi byte).
5. Calls `enable_interrupts()` — this is the point at which hardware interrupts
   first become active in the boot sequence.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `frequency` | Desired interrupt rate in Hz. Must divide evenly into 1 193 180 or the rate will be approximate. Maximum is 1 193 180 Hz (divisor = 1); minimum is ~18 Hz (divisor = 65535). |

### `timer_get_ticks`

```c
uint32_t timer_get_ticks(void);
```

Return the current tick count.  The counter starts at 0 and increments by 1
on every timer interrupt.  At 50 Hz it wraps after approximately 993 days of
continuous uptime.

### `ksleep`

```c
void ksleep(uint32_t ticks);
```

Busy-wait until at least `ticks` timer ticks have elapsed since the call.
At 50 Hz, `ksleep(50)` sleeps for approximately one second.

This is a spin-wait — the CPU executes a tight loop and does not yield.  It
is suitable for short post-boot delays but should be replaced with an
interrupt-driven sleep once a scheduler exists.

## Future work

- Replace the spin-wait in `ksleep` with an interrupt-driven sleep queue once
  a process scheduler is in place.
- Expose a monotonic clock interface (nanoseconds / seconds since boot) for
  use by higher-level subsystems and a future system-call layer.
- Add a one-shot alarm / callback registration API for kernel timers.
