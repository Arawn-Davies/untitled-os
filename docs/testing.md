# Testing Makar

This guide covers the automated test infrastructure. For build and run
instructions see [Building & Running](building.md).

---

## CI test suite (`./run.sh iso test`)

The single command for complete ISO CI validation:

```sh
./run.sh iso test
```

Runs two phases; build steps use Docker, QEMU/GDB prefer the host if available:

**Phase 1 - in-kernel ktest suite**

Boots `makar-test.iso` (single grub menuentry with `timeout=0`, `multiboot2 /boot/makar.kernel test_mode`). The kernel parses the multiboot2 cmdline, runs `ktest_run_all()` (all subsystem unit tests including a live ring-3 userspace execution), then exits QEMU cleanly via `isa-debug-exit`. Output: `ktest.log`.

`makar-test.iso` and `makar.iso` are emitted from the **same** kernel binary; there is no test-only build flag.

**Phase 2 - GDB boot-checkpoint tests**

Builds a normal debug ISO. Creates a 32 MiB FAT32 test disk and attaches it
on IDE:0 alongside the CD-ROM so the kernel can mount `/hd`. Launches QEMU
with the GDB stub and runs `tests/gdb_boot_test.py`. Output: `gdb-test.log`.

Exit code 0 = everything passed; 1 = any failure or timeout.

---

## HDD boot test (`./run.sh hdd test`)

Verifies the installed HDD boot path end-to-end - no CD-ROM attached:

```sh
./run.sh hdd test
```

What it does:

1. **Clean rebuild** - ensures `src/kernel/makar.kernel` (GDB symbol file) matches the binary written into the image.
2. **Generate `makar-hdd-test.img`** - fresh raw MBR + FAT32 + GRUB 2 image using the interactive kernel so `shell_run` is called and `vfs_auto_mount()` runs. Kept separate from `makar-hdd.img` so interactive and test images never share state.
3. **GDB boot test** - boots the image with `-boot c` (HDD-only) and runs `tests/gdb_hdd_test.py`.

Output files: `hdd-test-gdb.log`, `hdd-test-serial.log`.

---

## GDB test groups

Both `gdb_boot_test.py` (ISO boot) and `gdb_hdd_test.py` (HDD boot) run the
same four groups, providing equivalent external verification regardless of
boot medium:

| Group | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `boot_checkpoints` | Every major boot function reached in order: `kernel_main` → `terminal_initialize` → … → `shell_run` |
| `hardware_state` | CR0.PG set (paging enabled), CR3 non-zero (page directory loaded), `timer_callback` fires (PIT ticking) |
| `vesa` | VESA framebuffer active and TTY initialised (or absent without crashing - graceful headless) |
| `hdd_mount` | `fat32_mounted()` non-zero - FAT32 partition auto-mounted at `/hd` after `shell_run` |

The `hdd_mount` check advances execution to `keyboard_getchar` (the shell's
read-loop entry) before inspecting `fat32_mounted()`, ensuring
`vfs_auto_mount()` has fully completed.

The ISO GDB test creates the FAT32 test disk using `mkfs.fat --offset`
(sector-based, no losetup / `--privileged` needed), which works inside the
GitHub Actions container job.

To add a new group: create `tests/groups/<name>.py` exposing `NAME` and
`run() → bool`, then import it into **both** `gdb_boot_test.py` and
`gdb_hdd_test.py`.

## Interactive GDB debug

```sh
# Build a debug ISO first
./run.sh iso boot   # or: CFLAGS='-O0 -g3' ./run.sh iso release

# In one terminal - start QEMU with GDB stub (inside Docker)
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work arawn780/gcc-cross-i686-elf:fast \
    bash -lc 'qemu-system-i386 -cdrom makar.iso -s -S -display none -serial stdio'

# In another terminal - attach GDB (inside Docker or native)
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work arawn780/gcc-cross-i686-elf:fast \
    gdb-multiarch src/kernel/makar.kernel \
        -ex "target remote :1234" \
        -ex "break kernel_main" \
        -ex "continue"
```

The `-O0 -g3` flags ensure DWARF debug info is accurate. QEMU starts with
`-S` (freeze at reset), giving you time to set breakpoints before execution
begins.

---

## In-kernel unit tests (interactive)

From the kernel shell:

```
ktest
```

Runs `ktest_run_all()` and prints pass/fail for each subsystem suite
(PMM, heap, ring-3 execution, etc.) directly to the terminal and serial log.

---

## Black-box UI tests (`./run.sh ui`)

Drives the running kernel through QEMU's HMP `sendkey` and asserts on
the COM1 serial slice + PPM screen dump.  Scenarios live in
`tests/ui_test.sh` as `test_<name>` shell functions; the shared runner
in `tests/ui_runner.sh` boots one QEMU per invocation and rotates
through scenarios with `reset_shell` in between.

### Synchronisation: marker-based, not sleep-based

The shell emits `[shell:ready vt=N]` to serial on every
`shell_readline` entry (gated by `g_serial_verbose`, which
`start_qemu` flips on as the first action after boot).  Test
scenarios use this marker as a sync point instead of fixed `sleep N`:

| Primitive | What it does |
|---|---|
| `it <name> <script> [wait_secs]` | Fixed-sleep style.  Send keys, sleep, snapshot serial slice. |
| `it_until <name> <script> <regex> [timeout]` | **Sync-on-marker style.**  Send keys, poll the serial log until the regex appears, then snapshot.  Default sync regex is `'\[shell:ready vt=0\]'`. |
| `wait_for_serial <regex> <start_bytes> [timeout]` | Low-level primitive.  Polls `$SERIAL_LOG` from `<start_bytes>` until `<regex>` matches.  Used by `it_until` and directly by multi-stage scenarios that need to sync between key batches (the `typo-doesnt-clear` scenario is the canonical multi-stage example: type the typo, wait for shell-ready, then type the next command, otherwise the in-flight bytes race the dying exec'd child and get dropped when `keyboard_release_task` reaps its slot). |

This is the expect/pexpect pattern, scaled down.  Why it matters: a
fixed `sleep 1.2` is a guess that's right under KVM and wrong under
TCG-on-a-shared-runner.  A marker sync is right in both -- it returns
the instant the kernel says it's ready and bounds via the timeout.

### Scenarios currently covered

| Scenario | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `glob-proc` | `cat /proc/*` glob-expands across the synthetic FS |
| `tab-complete-path` | `cat<TAB> /proc/c<TAB><Enter>` resolves to `cat /proc/cpuinfo` |
| `exec-hello` | `exec /cdrom/apps/hello.elf tester` reaches `sys_exit(0)` and prints the expected greeting |
| `cd-root-listing` | `cd /<TAB><TAB>` lists mounts; subsequent `pwd` confirms cwd |
| `per-tty-cwd` | Per-task cwd isolation across `Alt+F1`/`Alt+F3` switches |
| `calc-brackets` | `calc.elf` evaluates parenthesised arithmetic |
| `ctrlc-kills-child` | Ctrl+C delivers SIGINT to a running ELF, shell recovers |
| `no-dead-in-proctasks` | `cat /proc/tasks` never lists DEAD slots |
| `typo-doesnt-clear` | A wrong command falls back to makbox, prints an error, and **does not** wipe the screen (proves the `task_t.fb_touched` gate) |
| `user-sigusr1-handler` | `sigtest.elf` installs a SIGUSR1 handler, self-sends, the handler runs in ring 3 (proves the sigframe + trampoline + `SYS_SIGRETURN` path) |
| `makbox-pwd` | `pwd` resolves to the `makbox` applet end-to-end |

`./run.sh ui` runs all of them; `./run.sh ui <name>` runs
one; `./run.sh ui graphical` runs with a visible QEMU window for
debugging.

## CI

`.github/workflows/build-test.yml` runs a **build-once, fan-out** topology on every push to `main` and every PR. Docs-only changes are skipped via path filter.

| Job | Runner | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | `ubuntu-latest` (host, Docker available) | `./run.sh iso build` + `./run.sh hdd build` → uploads `makar.kernel`, `makar.iso`, `makar-test.iso`, `makar-hdd-test.img` as artifact `makar-build` |
| `ktest` | `ubuntu-latest` + container `arawn780/gcc-cross-i686-elf:fast` | downloads artifact → `./run.sh ktest` |
| `gdb-iso` | `ubuntu-latest` + container | downloads artifact → `./run.sh gdb iso` |
| `gdb-hdd` | `ubuntu-latest` + container | downloads artifact → `./run.sh gdb hdd` |

Why this shape:
- One compile → three parallel test runs. The compile is the expensive step; the test jobs are I/O-bound on QEMU boot.
- The `build` job runs on the host (not in a container) because `generate-hdd.sh` spawns its own privileged Docker container for loop-device work, which is awkward to nest.
- The test jobs run inside the toolchain container so they get `qemu-system-i386` and `gdb-multiarch` without further setup.
- KVM acceleration is deliberately disabled (see `run.sh _qemu_accel`); software breakpoints under the GDB stub never catch on KVM, and ktest hit a path-fault masked by KVM's CPU timing.
- ccache is cached across runs via `actions/cache@v4` with the cascade `ccache-${{ runner.os }}-${{ github.sha }}` → `ccache-${{ runner.os }}-${{ github.ref_name }}-` → `ccache-${{ runner.os }}-main-` → `ccache-${{ runner.os }}-`. Warm rebuilds hit ~47 % cache.

The `release.yml` workflow gates artifact publication on `build-test.yml` succeeding via `workflow_call`.
