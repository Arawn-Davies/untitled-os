 * keyboard.c -- PS/2 keyboard driver (layered, SMP-ready).
 *
 *   IRQ1 byte  -->  [decoder]      scancode set 1 + e0/e1 prefixes,
 *                                  strict make/break separation.
 *               -->  [translator]  keycode + modifier state -> cooked byte
 *                                  (ASCII printable, ASCII control, or one
 *                                   of the KEY_* sentinel bytes 0x80..0x88).
 *               -->  [router]      per-task SPSC ring (with proper memory
 *                                  ordering) or the global fallback ring.
 *
 * Public API (kernel/keyboard.h) is unchanged -- this is a drop-in replacement
 * for the previous monolithic handler.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * 1. WHY THIS REWRITE EXISTS
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The prior driver had three classes of latent bug, each of which has been
 * directly observed in production (see PR #123 thread):
 *
 *   1. "Sticky e0" -- the extended_key flag was a single bit set on every
 *      0xE0 byte and cleared only by the next non-prefix byte. If a byte was
 *      ever dropped (typematic burst, lost EOI under load, an emulator
 *      hiccup) the bit persisted and silently corrupted the *next* normal
 *      scancode -- e.g. a plain 'a' arriving in DEC_AFTER_E0 would surface
 *      as KEY_ARROW_<something>. The new decoder is a four-state machine,
 *      and an unexpected prefix byte cleanly restarts the relevant prefix
 *      instead of poisoning what follows.
 *
 *   2. SPSC ring race -- the IRQ producer wrote `slot->buf[head]` and then
 *      incremented `head` with no barrier between the two stores. On -O2
 *      the compiler is free to reorder, and a consumer that observed the
 *      new head before the new byte landed would read stale ring memory.
 *      That is the most likely cause of the "sporadic single-character noise
 *      not correlated to keystrokes" symptom flagged in CLAUDE.md slice #5.
 *      Producer and consumer now bracket every data/head pair with
 *      smp_wmb()/smp_rmb() so neither the compiler nor a future SMP runtime
 *      can shuffle the ordering.
 *
 *   3. Slot-table tearing -- the old kb_find_or_register() mutated the slot
 *      array and kb_nslots from task context with no synchronisation. An
 *      IRQ1 firing mid-mutation would walk a partial table and either
 *      dereference garbage or route to the wrong task. The new design is
 *      lock-free and uses a fixed-slot scheme (slots are never compacted;
 *      owner==NULL means free). All updates go through atomic builtins so
 *      the IRQ side always observes a consistent snapshot, and cross-CPU
 *      registration races are resolved by a single CAS.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * 2. UNSIGNED CHAR END-TO-END
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Internal types are uint8_t / unsigned char throughout the pipeline. The
 * sentinel keycodes (KEY_ARROW_UP and friends in keyboard.h) live in
 * 0x80..0x88. When stored as a signed `char` and widened to `int` they
 * sign-extend to 0xFFFFFF80.., which is fatal to any comparison that goes
 * via `int` -- e.g. `c >= 0x80` evaluates to false for a signed char with
 * value (char)0x80 because it becomes -128 < 128. As long as both operands
 * stay `char`, equality survives the widening; that's why the public API
 * still returns `char`. But the entire *producer* pipeline is unsigned, and
 * the conversion happens at exactly one place: the keyboard_{getchar,poll}
 * return path.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * 3. MEMORY ORDERING / SMP READINESS
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Makar is currently UP, but the design is SMP-correct so we do not have to
 * revisit this driver when SMP lands. The relevant facts:
 *
 *   - x86 (and x86_64) is TSO. Plain aligned scalar loads and stores up to
 *     pointer width are atomic, and the only reordering hardware will do is
 *     StoreLoad (a load may be observed before an earlier store to a
 *     different address). Inside the SPSC ring's data/head pair, both
 *     ordering directions we care about are StoreStore (producer) and
 *     LoadLoad (consumer), neither of which x86 reorders. So smp_wmb() and
 *     smp_rmb() collapse to compiler-only barriers on this architecture --
 *     same as Linux's barrier.h on i386.
 *
 *   - Cross-CPU full barriers (smp_mb()) require LOCK or MFENCE. We do not
 *     need one anywhere in the data path. The atomic builtins used for
 *     pointer publication are already SEQ_CST on x86 by the way GCC emits
 *     them on aligned stores.
 *
 *   - The IRQ handler can in principle run concurrently on two CPUs in the
 *     future (per-CPU local APIC vectors, or one CPU servicing keyboard
 *     while another sends to a task). The kb_io_lock spinlock serialises
 *     the controller drain so two CPUs can't tear the PS/2 byte stream.
 *     It is irq-safe (cli before acquire, restore on release) and on UP
 *     reduces to a no-op contention path.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * 4. CONTROLLER HYGIENE
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * On every IRQ we read the status register first, drain up to a bounded
 * number of bytes from the data port, and skip mouse bytes (AUXB=1). We
 * filter the controller's own response codes (0x00 buffer-error, 0xAA BAT-
 * pass, 0xFA ack, 0xFE resend, 0xFF buffer-overflow) defensively. The
 * decoder never blocks; if the controller wedges, we ack what we have and
 * return.

 * scancode for LSHIFT (make 0x2A | 0x80). The BAT-pass byte is only
 * emitted at power-on/reset, before keyboard_init drains the buffer
 * and registers the IRQ handler, so it never reaches decoder_feed.
 * Filtering it unconditionally would silently swallow every LSHIFT
 * release -- this was a real bug surfaced by the new ktest harness.
 *
 * Once the kernel starts sending controller commands (LED sync, scan-
 * code-set selection) the right way to disambiguate replies from
 * scancodes is a per-command "expecting reply" window driven by the
 * command queue (Linux's i8042 layer does this); for now we have no
 * commands in flight so the simpler "never filter 0xAA" suffices.
